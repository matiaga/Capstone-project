## Project Overview:
The "ML Shoes Price Prediction Project" aims to predict the prices of shoes using machine learning techniques. The project involves several stages, starting from web scraping to gather data, configuring a database for storage, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ultimately developing a machine learning model for price prediction.

## Project Steps:
1. Web Scraping:

Objective: Gather data on shoes from relevant websites.

Tools: Python, Selenium/Beautiful Soup for web scraping.

Tasks:

- Identify target websites with shoe data.
- Extract information such as brand, product description, price, and any other relevant features.
- Store the scraped data in a structured format.
2. Database Configuration:
Objective: Set up a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Tools: SQLite, MySQL, or another relational database.
Tasks:
Design a schema to represent shoe data.
Create a database and tables to store the scraped information.
Establish a connection between the database and the Python environment.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Objective: Gain insights into the collected data.
Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
Tasks:
Explore the distribution of shoe prices.
Identify patterns or correlations between features.
Handle missing or outlier data.
4. Data Preprocessing:
Objective: Prepare the data for machine learning.
Tools: Scikit-Learn, Pandas.
Tasks:
Handle categorical variables.
Normalize or scale numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Feature Engineering:
Objective: Enhance the dataset for better model performance.
Tools: Scikit-Learn, Pandas.
Tasks:
Create new features if necessary.
Encode categorical variables.
Handle text data if applicable.
6. Model Development:
Objective: Build a machine learning model for price prediction.
Tools: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch (depending on the complexity).
Tasks:
Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., linear regression, random forest, or neural network).
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset.
7. Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:
Objective: Assess the model's accuracy and refine if necessary.
Tools: Scikit-Learn.
Tasks:
Evaluate the model's performance metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better results.
8. Documentation and Reporting:
Objective: Summarize the project and outcomes.
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, or other documentation tools.
Tasks:
Create a detailed report documenting each step.
Explain the model's predictions and limitations.
Provide recommendations for future improvements.
## Conclusion:
The "ML Shoes Price Prediction Project" involves a comprehensive approach, combining web scraping, data management, exploratory analysis, and machine learning to predict shoe prices accurately. This structured approach ensures the project's success and provides valuable insights into the world of shoe pricing.
